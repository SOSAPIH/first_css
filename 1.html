<strong>Naver (Hangul: 네이버) is a <u>South Korean</u> online platform</strong> operated by the Naver Corporation. It debuted in 1999 as the first web portal in South Korea to develop and use its own search engine.

It was also the world's first operator to introduce the comprehensive search feature, which compiles search results from various categories and presents them in a single page. Naver has since added a multitude of new services ranging from basic features such as e-mail and news to the world's first online Q&A platform Knowledge iN.
